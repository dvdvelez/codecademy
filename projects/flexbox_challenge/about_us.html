        <h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
        <h5>
          The Soft Alpaca is a small company that had a modest and humble beginning with the idea of bringing the warmth and softness of Peru's indigenous alpaca wool to the world!<br>
          Founded in December 2022 by it's current owner, The Soft Alpaca aimed to be the go-to provider of the world's finest alpaca yarns to hobbyists and other small companies.<br>
          With the help of Houston, TX's burgeoning Peruvian community, we have rapidly grown our business and operation and have started supplying customers in ever greater quantities of alpaca yarn.

        <h3>Quality and Authenticity</h3>
        <h5>
          Our Peruvian crafters employ their time-honed and ancient craftsmanship to produce the world's softest and finest alpaca wool which is then processed into spools of yarn.<br>
          From there, each spool of yarn is inspected for quality and authenticity and tagged with a unique lot number by our Peruvian counterparts overseeing the production of our alpaca yarns.<br>
          Lot numbers are found on the back of each yarn label and are further recorded in our database for quick and orderly alerts to our customers in rare cases of product recalls.

        <h3>Ethical Standards and Fair Trade</h3>
        <h5>
          The Soft Alpaca strives to ethically source only from suppliers who are overseen by Peruvian authorities and various Andean indigenous human-rights organizations.<br>
          In addition, we work in collaboration with our Peruvian partners and maintain a mutually fair trade agreement which is also overseen by the Peruvian authorities and laws.<br>
          Alpaca wool production is ethical in that alpacas are given the best quality of life as they are a means of life, finance, and cultural identity for the indigenous communities of Peru.
